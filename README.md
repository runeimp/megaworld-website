MegaWorld v1
============

How This All Began
------------------

This is the source for the website I created for my pen and paper <abbr title="Roleplaying Game">RPG</abbr>, MegaWorld. The game was intended to have the following features

* Sci-Fy (Science Fantasy) -- Aliens, cybernetics, laser guns, mecha, railguns, robots, and space travel! As well as dragons, elves, enchanted realms, magick users, and unicorns!
* Simple game mechanics -- I personally have no interest in referencing charts to reference other charts to break out the calculator on my smartphone. Those kinds of games can be very ingaging but I'm much more about the roleplaying or storytelling aspect of pen and paper <abbr title="Roleplaying Game">RPG</abbr>s.
* Uses standard 6 sided dice -- I love polyheadron dice but they can be very hard to find at times. Or at least were a pain back in 1995. In 2016 this you can find anything you want online and dice rollers are aplenty for computers and smartphones. But I still like the idea that you can go into almost any drug or grocery store to physically pick up the only dice you need for the game.

### Why This Repo Exists

The original site was done with Dreamweaver (4?) and I decided to move it over to [Hugo][] because I wanted something static but much easier to create content in other than raw HTML. I also wanted to updated the site to HTML5 a CSS3 (version 1 of this source is not a greate example though) and have control over a great templating engine similar to {{ mustache }}. I really like Markdown for content and was impressed with [Hugo][] and it's obvious influences as it was written in the [Go][] programming language. I've been learning [Go][] recently and like the way it _thinks_. So I'm very happy thus far with [Hugo][]. It's quite impressive as a development platform for static website generation. In any case the process has inspired me to add a fair bit more content to what was my original site. I hope to have it online again soon.

Clarification
-------------

This content is regarding the MegaWorld pen and paper <abbr title="Roleplaying Game">RPG</abbr> which I (Mark Preston Gardner AKA RuneImp) initially created back in 1995. At the time I had no knowledge of any other entity using or intending to use either _Megaworld_ or _Mega World_ to reference their company or products. I've yet to have play Mega Man. I'm sure it's a wonderful game. I've just never gotten around to it. So, until this writing, I had no prior knowledge that the first Mega Man game was release as [Rockman Mega World][Rockman Mega World - Wikipedia] in Japan. I have not yet created a digital version of my game other than a dice roller written in Flash. So if your looking for another _megaworld_ game or entity I have compiled the following list <time datetime="2016-09-12">today</time> in an effort to help those lost souls who have not yet been enthralled by my own game (yeah, it's still pretty rough) and are looking for something else.
