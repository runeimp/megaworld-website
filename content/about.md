About MegaWorld
===============

MegaWord was a pen and paper <abbr title="Roleplaying Game">RPG</abbr> concept I had back in the early 1990's. I greatly enjoyed playing <abbr title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">[Dungeons & Dragons][D&D]</abbr> (original and 2nd Edition), [Marvel Super Heroes][], [Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game][], [Cyberpunk 2020][], [GURPS][], [Justifiers RPG][]
