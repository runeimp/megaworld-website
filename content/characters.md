In the MegaWorld system, characters are based on 5 _Primary Attributes_. Primary Attributes determine the number of dice you will roll with a given _Skill_. Primary Attributes may be from 1 to 5 for "normal" humans (though I suspect there won't be many of those floating around) or as high as 8 for an effective topper for unaltered (but extremely rare) humans. Attributes cost 10 for 1 <abbr title="Character Points">CP</abbr>. You distribute your <abbr title="Attribute Points">AP</abbr> among your attributes during character creation. But your character will start out with a set number of <abbr title="Attribute Points">AP</abbr> depending on the type of campaign the <acronym title="Game Operations Director">GOD</acronym> is running. Secondary Attributes do not effect any Skills but instead effect specific actions or situations. Here is a list of the Primary Attributes and Secondary Attributes.
