"Exceptional Damage" is damage equal to the BLD of the victim & if done to a limb renders that limb useless.
"Massive Damage" is damage double the BLD of the victim & if done to a limb severs it.

**Stun Damage** is the Task Number for a Fatigue Roll. Failing the roll indicates the target must add the difference of the failure (divided by BLD) to there Fatigue. Critical Failure indicates the target is stunned and must add the value of the Task Number to there current Wounds.

**Normal Damage** is the Task Number for a Wound Roll. Failure indicates the target is Wounded and must add the difference of the failure (divided by BLD) to there Wounds. A Critical Failure indicates the target is Mortally Wounded and adds the Task Number to there Mortal Wounds. The Wounds are added to all Task Numbers.

**Mortal Damage** is the Task Number for a Mortality Roll. Failure indicates the target is Mortally Wounded and must add the difference of the failure (divided by BLD) to there Mortal Wounds. Critical Failure indicates the target died.

**Damage System:** A successful strike does half damage unless the character beat the TN by 5 or better. In which case the character deals max damage.

**Optional Damage System 1:** Divide up the damage by 5 and have 5 damage categories instead of two.

**Optional Damage System 2:** Weapon damage equals number if dice rolled. The Skill of the dice is determined by the amount the character beat the TN by +1. Matching the TN is Skill 1. Beating the TN by 4 is Skill 5. Beating the TN by 5 means Max Damage. Then the target rolls BLD/Athletics. Takes that number & divides the Damage by it to determine how many wounds are incurred.

**Incapacitation & Mortality:** Once Wounds or Fatigue are equal to or greater than the characters Build the character is Incapacitated. If the character sustains Wounds twice as much as the characters Build then that character becomes unconscious. A character who receives Wounds greater than there Build in one blow dies instantly. If that character sustains Mortal Wounds greater than there Build they die.

### Optional Incapacitation & Mortality

**Incapacitation:** At the end of every round in which a character's Wounds or Fatigue is greater than there Build the character rolls Power/Will Power (Self-Control) vs. Fatigue or Wounds (which ever is greater). If the character fails the roll then they are incapacitated. Either overcome with fatigue or shock. Though they are not necessarily unconscious. If the critically fail then they fall unconscious.
**Mortality:** Also at the end of every round  in which a character's Mortal Wounds are greater than there Build the character rolls Power/Will Power (Self-Control) vs. Mortal Wounds. If they fail they die.
