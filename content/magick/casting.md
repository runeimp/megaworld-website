Casting time takes 4 actions. Doubling the difficulty of the spell halves the casting time. Halving the difficulty doubles the casting time. Keeping a power up increases the difficulty of other skill rolls by 1. To have a spell "ready to go" means casting that spell and keeping it up until used. Keeping up a spell confers a -1 to all actions.

Reaction Skills take one action.

Ritual takes 15 minutes. All magic users with at least 1 point in the appropriate skill can add there full Power. If they don't have at least 1 point in the appropriate skill or a 3 in Prime then they can only add half there power rounded down.

The TN (difficulty) equals Distance + Area + Duration x Reality Quotient. Extra successes indicate the power of the spell.
